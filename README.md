# Cpp-AutoInliner
 A tool to automatically inline macros in a given .cpp / .h file.
 I made it to help with my workflow, but also because I wanted to see what the compiler might see after inlining but before compiling.

It doesn't handle multi-line macros yet. Hopefully I will get support for that added soon.
